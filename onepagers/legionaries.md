## Faction Rules
- Astartes: During activation, can perform two Shoot or two Fight actions (if double‑Shoot, one must be a bolt/tainted bolt pistol/boltgun).
- Marks of Chaos: Choose KHORNE/NURGLE/SLAANESH/TZEENTCH/UNDIVIDED per operative for a unique bonus and ploy synergies (Balefire Acolyte cannot be KHORNE).
- Counteract: Can react regardless of order.

## Signature Ploys (Examples)
- Mark‑keyed ploys that amplify melee burst, survivability, mobility, or reliability depending on chosen marks.

## Game Plan & Tips
- Map marks to jobs (e.g., Nurgle on holders; Slaanesh on movers; Khorne on beaters).
- Use Astartes double‑action turns to spike damage (shoot+shoot or fight+fight).
- Keep Icon/Psyker safe; trade Warriors early for position.
- Prioritise Tac Ops that reward mid‑board control and decisive picks.

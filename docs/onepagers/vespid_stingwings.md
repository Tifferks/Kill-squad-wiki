# Vespid Stingwings — One‑Pager

## Overview
- Fast flying skirmishers with a command-economy constraint via Communion points.
- Excel at mobility and target isolation but must budget points for mission play.

## Roster Highlights
- Strain Leader, Oversight Drone (Communion boost), Shadestrain (stealth assassin), Longsting (sniper), Skyblast (neutron grenade launcher), Swarmguard (flamer), Warriors.

## Faction Rules — Communion
- Strategy phase: Gain D3 Communion points (+1 if Oversight Drone in killzone).
- Constraints unless you spend 1 point:
  - Shooting: Must target closest enemy within 8" (excl. enemies within friendly control ranges).
  - Charge: Must finish within control range of the closest enemy it can.
  - Mission: Must spend 1 point to Pick Up or perform a mission action.
- Boost: When shooting, you can spend 1 point (only 1) to reroll one attack die.

## Signature Ploys (Examples)
- Hardened Exoskeleton (defence boost), Ocelli (enhanced spotting/vision plays).

## Archetypes
- Recon; Seek & Destroy.

## Loadout Notes
- Oversight Drone is high priority to keep Communion flow; Shadestrain for surgical picks; Swarmguard to punish groups.

## Game Plan & Tips
- Budget points early for mission actions and key non-closest shots; don’t starve late game.
- Use speed to make the “closest target” the one you actually want.
- Leverage elevation and angles; Longsting repositions to safe vantage points.

# Tempestus Aquilons — One‑Pager

## Overview
- Elite drop troops with precise Gravchute landings and shock firepower.
- Threaten multiple objectives with marker-driven deployment.

## Roster Highlights
- Tempestor (leader), Precursor (lands aggressively), Servosentry (mech fire support), Gunfighter (dual pistols), Gunner (melta/plasma carbines), Marksman (long‑las), Grenadier, Troopers.

## Faction Rules
- Drop Markers & Above-Board Deployment: Set operatives “above” and land them during Firefight activations within 3" of a Drop marker or in drop zone; ignore vertical distance on landing; Obscured until end of next activation/TP (as specified).
- Limits: Less than half your operatives can remain above after TP1; Drop markers are removed in later TPs, stranding unlanded operatives.

## Signature Ploys (Examples)
- Sudden Offensive: Early-activation Aquilons gain Balanced (x equals half your operative count, rounded up).
- Hot Drop: After rolling attacks for a just-landed operative vs a target within 6", reroll any attack dice.
- Adjust Coordinates: Utility for marker/landing flexibility.

## Archetypes
- Recon; Seek & Destroy.

## Loadout Notes
- Mix melta/plasma carbines based on expected armor; Marksman to pick exposed threats; Precursor to crack screens.

## Game Plan & Tips
- Pre-plan Drop markers’ horizontal moves in Strategy phase; chain landings to overload a flank.
- Land most of the team by end of TP1 to avoid losses; keep one surprise for tempo.
- Use Hot Drop to secure high-value kills within 6" the moment you land.
- Protect Servosentry lanes; it anchors your mid-game.

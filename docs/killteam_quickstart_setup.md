# Kill Team: Quickstart Rules & Setup

## Overview
- Skirmish game with alternating activations and mission-focused scoring.
- Each battle is split into Turning Points (rounds). You score via mission primaries and Tac Ops.
- Your faction’s datacards, ploys, and unique rules define your playstyle and toolset.

## Setup (At a Glance)
- Mission: Choose a mission pack and mission (e.g., Open, Critical Ops, etc.).
- Killzone: Set up terrain as instructed; note Heavy, Light, Vantage, and Walls (for close quarters).
- Teams: Build your legal kill team per faction sheet; select equipment if applicable.
- Tac Ops: Pick according to your listed archetypes (often 3 Tac Ops for most mission packs).
- Orders: Deploy operatives with an order: Engage (fight/shoot) or Conceal (harder to be targeted).

## Turn Sequence (Each Turning Point)
1) Strategy Phase
   - Gain/refresh CP (usually 1 CP) and resolve mission steps.
   - Use Strategic Gambits and Strategy ploys.
   - Ready operatives.
2) Firefight Phase
   - Alternate activating operatives (you, then opponent, and so on).
   - Each activation: Spend AP to Move, Reposition/Dash, Shoot, Fight, perform mission actions, or unique actions.
3) End Phase
   - Score and clean up per mission rules; flip used tokens; prepare for next Turning Point.

## Orders, Visibility, and Obscurity
- Orders: Engage allows shooting/fighting; Conceal improves safety (cannot shoot unless a rule allows).
- Obscured: If Obscured and more than a certain threshold from visible enemies (and/or with terrain requirements), shooting at you is restricted per mission pack rules.
- Vantage: Units under Vantage are often more easily seen; some rules reference being under or on Vantage.

## Action Points (AP) and Common Actions
- Most operatives have 2 AP.
- Common actions: Move, Reposition/Dash, Shoot, Fight, Pick Up, Mission actions, unique faction/operative actions.
- Charge: A move into combat followed by Fight (typically costs AP as listed on datacard).

## Shooting and Melee Basics
- Attacker rolls attack dice; defender rolls defence dice.
- Criticals usually beat normals; weapon rules may change faces/damage.
- Cover: Often lets you retain one or more saves without rolling (depending on terrain and visibility).
- Weapon traits example keywords you’ll see: Balanced, Blast, Torrent, Saturate, Severe, etc.

## Counteract (Reactions)
- Some teams here can “counteract regardless of order,” enabling reactions even while Concealed. Use this to blunt enemy plays during their activations.

## Command Points (CP) and Ploys
- Strategy Ploys: Used in Strategy/Firefight phases for broad buffs or tempo.
- Firefight Ploys: Instant tactical tricks during activations or specific triggers.
- Plan CP usage for swing turns rather than trickling away.

## Tac Ops and Archetypes
- Tac Ops are your secondary objectives. You select from archetypes shown on your team sheet (e.g., Security, Recon, Seek & Destroy).
- Read scoring triggers and plan deployment/movement to satisfy conditions early.

## New Player Tips
- Mission First: Killing helps, but objectives win games.
- Orders Discipline: Stay Concealed until you can meaningfully act.
- Activation Planning: Think 2–3 activations ahead to create dilemmas.
- Terrain Use: Heavy and Vantage matter for line-of-sight and Obscurity.
- Measure Control Range: Many abilities trigger within control range (commonly 2").
- Bank CP: Save for pivotal ploys (e.g., denial or big damage spikes).
